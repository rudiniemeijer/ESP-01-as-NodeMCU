# Use the ESP-01 as a full-featured NodeMCU
The NodeMCU is a small, USB-powered Internet of Things development board, featuring an ESP-11 System on a Chip as the main central processing unit, an USB-to-serial converter and a voltage regulator.

The ESP-01 is the first generation of ESP System on a Chip boards, with the same internals as the later ESP-11, but far less pins. In order to use the ESP-01
